0,A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning,Pedro Domingos,https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf,"Machine learning systems automatically learn programs from data. This is often a very attractive alternative to manually constructing them, and in the last decade the use of machine learning has spread rapidly throughout computer science and beyond. Machine learning is used in Web search, spam filters, recommender systems, ad placement, credit scoring, fraud detection, stock trading, drug design, and many other applications. A recent report from the McKinsey Global Institute asserts that machine learning (a.k.a. data mining or predictive analytics) will be the driver of the next big wave of innovation [16]. Several fine textbooks are available to interested practitioners and researchers (e.g, [17, 25]). However, much of the “folk knowledge” that is needed to successfully develop machine learning applications is not readily available in them. As a result, many machine learning projects take much longer than necessary or wind up producing lessthan-ideal results. Yet much of this folk knowledge is fairly easy to communicate",intermediate
1,Machine Learning: An artificial intelligence methodology,Anish Talwar,http://www.ijecs.in/issue/v2-i12/11%20ijecs.pdf,"Learning is considered as a parameter for intelligent machines. Deep understanding would help in taking decisions in a more optimized form and also help then to work in most efficient method. As seeing is intelligence, so learning is also becoming a key to the study of biological and artificial vision. Instead of building heavy machines with explicit programming now different algorithms are being introduce which will help the machine to understand the virtual environment and based on their understanding the machine will take particular decision. This will eventually decrease the number of programming concepts and also machine will become independent and take decisions on their own",intermediate
2,Machine learning: the power and promise of computers that learn by example,The Royal Society,https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/machine-learning/publications/machine-learning-report.pdf,"Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence that allows computer systems to learn from examples, data, and experience. Through enabling computers to perform specific tasks intelligently, machine learning systems can carry out complex processes by learning from data, rather than following pre-programmed rules.",intermediate
3,INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING,Nils J. Nilsson,http://robotics.stanford.edu/people/nilsson/MLBOOK.pdf,"s. The book concentrates on the important ideas in machine learning. I do not give proofs of many of the theorems that I state, but I do give plausibility arguments and citations to formal proofs. And, I do not treat many matters that would be of practical importance in applications; the book is not a handbook of machine learning practice. Instead, my goal is to give the reader sufficient preparation to make the extensive literature on machine learning accessible.",intermediate
4,Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms,Shai Shalev-Shwartz,https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf,"The term machine learning refers to the automated detection of meaningful patterns in data. In the past couple of decades it has become a common tool in almost any task that requires information extraction from large data sets. We are surrounded by a machine learning based technology: search engines learn how to bring us the best results (while placing profitable ads), anti-spam software learns to filter our email messages, and credit card transactions are secured by a software that learns how to detect frauds. Digital cameras learn to detect faces and intelligent personal assistance applications on smart-phones learn to recognize voice commands. Cars are equipped with accident prevention systems that are built using machine learning algorithms. Machine learning is also widely used in scientific applications such as bioinformatics, medicine, and astronomy. One common feature of all of these applications is that, in contrast to more traditional uses of computers, in these cases, due to the complexity of the patterns that need to be detected, a human programmer cannot provide an explicit, finedetailed specification of how such tasks should be executed. Taking example from intelligent beings, many of our skills are acquired or refined through learning from our experience (rather than following explicit instructions given to us). Machine learning tools are concerned with endowing programs with the ability to “learn” and adapt. The first goal of this book is to provide a rigorous, yet easy to follow, introduction to the main concepts underlying machine learning: What is learning? How can a machine learn? How do we quantify the resources needed to learn a given concept? Is learning always possible? Can we know if the learning process succeeded or failed? The second goal of this book is to present several key machine learning algorithms. We chose to present algorithms that on one hand are successfully used in practice and on the other hand give a wide spectrum of different learning techniques. Additionally, we pay specific attention to algorithms appropriate for large scale learning (a.k.a. “Big Data”), since in recent years, our world has become increasingly “digitized” and the amount of data available for learning is dramatically increasing. As a result, in many applications data is plentiful and computation time is the main bottleneck. We therefore explicitly quantify both the amount of data and the amount of computation time needed to learn a given concept.",intermediate

Mitchell,http://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/~gabis/ml/ml-books/McGrawHill%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20-Tom%20Mitchell.pdf,"Presents the key algorithms and theory that form the core of machine learning. Discusses such theoretical issues as How does learning performance vary with the number of training examples presented? and Which learning algorithms are most appropriate for various types of learning tasks? DLC: Computer algorithms. Book Description: This book covers the field of machine learning, which is the study of algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience. The book is intended to support upper level undergraduate and introductory level graduate courses in machine learning",intermediate
